# Python-Assignment-3

This repository contains two Python scripts (`assignment3_task1.py` and `assignment3_task2.py`) that demonstrate Functions & Modules in Python.

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### Description:
The `assignment3_task1.py` script calculates the factorial of a number provided by the user. It offers three different methods to achieve this:
* Method 1: Using a `for` loop.
* Method 2: Using a `while` loop.
* Method 3: Using recursion.

The script prompts the user to enter a number and then prints the factorial result from each of the three methods to the console.

### Assumptions:
* The user will input a valid integer value. The program does not include error handling for non-numeric or negative input.

### Example Output:
```
Enter a number: 5

Output using Method 1
Factorial of 5 is: 120

Output using Method 2
Factorial of 5 is: 120

Output using Method 3
Factorial of 5 is: 120
```

### How to Run:
1.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3.  Run the script using the following command:
    ```bash
    python assignment3_task1.py
    ```
4.  Follow the prompts to enter a number.

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### Description:
The `assignment3_task2.py` script performs basic mathematical operations on a user-provided number using the `math` module. It prompts the user to enter a number and then calculates and displays the following:
* Square root of the number
* Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
* Sine of the number (in radians)

### Assumptions:
* The user will input a valid integer or float value. The program does not include error handling for non-numeric input.

### Example Output:
```
Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303
```

### How to Run:
1.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3.  Run the script using the following command:
    ```bash
    python assignment3_task2.py
    ```
4.  Follow the prompts to enter a number.
